This lesson will introduce you to basic terminology and the fundamental syntax of HTML.

<!-- more start -->
## 1. Terminology {: .hN .beta #terminology}

There are many versions of HTML, but the latest&mdash;and one that is becoming increasingly used&mdash;is the [HTML5 "Living Standard"](http://developers.whatwg.org/). HTML5 evolved from earlier standards and was designed to be simple, powerful and backwards-compatible. This document uses HTML5 syntax, semantics and conventions throughout; the terms "HTML" and "HTML5" are used interchangeably.

> [W3C](http://w3.org)
> {: .attribution .micro}

The "M" in <abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> stands for _markup_; writing HTML boils down to _marking up_ content to identify it and give it meaning, just like annotating a book.


### 1.1 Elements & Tags {: .hN .gamma #elements-and-tags}

HTML **elements** are used to mark up different content in a document and specify what each bit of content is supposed to be.	
	
	<div>
{: .prettyprint}

Elements are composed of a **start tag** and an **end tag**. Tags are always surrounded by a set of angle brackets. Naturally, opening tags mark the beginning of an element; closing tags mark the end of an element and must begin with a forward slash:

	<h1>This is a level 1 header</h1>
	<p>this is text in a paragraph.</p>
{: .prettyprint}

Some elements are made up of one, **self-closing tag**:

	<img src="image.jpg">
	<img src="image.jpg" />
{: .prettyprint}

Both lines in the above example are correct. An optional forward slash (`/`) can be written before the closing bracket in a self-closing tag, though it is only necessary when using a non-HTML5 [doctype](#).


### 1.2 Attributes {: .hN .gamma #attributes}

While elements define the actual content, **attributes** define extra information about those elements, such as the location of a source file or a class/id name. Attributes are always written inside the angle brackets of a tag, _never_ between tags or in a closing tag.
	
	<div id="container">…</div>
{: .prettyprint}

Attributes have a **name** and a **value**., which are separated by an equals sign (`=`). In the above example, the `div` element has been given an `id` attribute with a value of "container". An attribute can only be defined once in a single tag, but some attributes allow multiple values:

	<div class="container alpha">...</div>
{: .prettyprint}


### 1.3 Comments {: .hN .gamma #comments}

Comments are pieces of text within the HTML document that are hidden from the browser. They serve as notes and explanations for the surrounding code. To leave a comment in HTML:

	<!-- I am a comment, wrapped in this funky string of symbols -->
{: .prettyprint}


## 2. Structure {: .hN .beta #structure}

In theory, an appropriate file extension (`.html`, `.htm`) is all that a browser requires to read a document as HTML. However, HTML is a formal language and errors occur if the proper syntax and structure isn't used. A well-formed HTML document requires the following:

1. A `doctype` declaration
2. The `html` root element
3. The `head` element
4. The `body` sectioning element 


### 2.1 doctype {: .hN .gamma #doctype}

A `doctype` declaration is used to instruct browsers which version of HTML is being used, and should be on the first line of an HTML document. Declaring a `doctype` always begins with an exclamation mark (`!`) character and is placed inside angle brackets (`< >`). This is the HTML5 `doctype`:

	<!doctype html>
{: .prettyprint}

"A `doctype` is necessary to force browsers to render in standards mode and prevent quirks-mode headaches in Internet Explorer." - Mark Brown, http://www.yellowshoe.com.au/standards/


### 2.2 \<html> {: .hN .gamma #html-element}

`html` is the document _root_, or the top-most element on the page (after `doctype`, which is not an element). It is written with opening and closing tags, marking the beginning and end of the HTML document. The `html` element contains all other elements; nothing can be written after the `</html>` tag. 

	<!doctype html>
	<html>
		<!-- everything else goes in here -->
	</html>
{: .prettyprint}

The `html` element accepts attributes (like `class`) but often only specifies the `lang` attribute.
 
	<html lang="en">

While not required to validate, the `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the an element's content - in this case, the entire document.

The `html` tag can be partially styled with CSS. As a general guide, typographic and background/color styles are accepted, while layout and box-model styles are not (see CSS).


### 2.3 \<head> {: .hN .gamma #head-element}

The first element inside `<html>` is always the `head` element. It is not rendered by the browser; it contains any metadata for the HTML document, along with links to external resources like scripts or stylesheets. 

	<html lang="en">
		<head>
			…
		</head>
{: .prettyprint}

The `<head>` often contains two metadata elements, one of which is required - `title`. The `title` element represents the overarching title or name of the page.

	<title>Waldo's Widget Emporium</title>
{: .prettyprint}

"The document's title is often different from its first heading, since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of context." - [WHATWG](http://developers.whatwg.org/semantics.html)

The second recommended element is a "character encoding declaration":

	<meta charset="utf-8">
{: .prettyprint}

The `meta` element is used to add different kinds of meta-information to the document. Using the `charset` attribute, it specifies the type of character encoding used on the page - in the example above, UTF-8. UTF-8, or Unicode, is a world-wide standard and a sensible default.

Character encoding should always be explicitly set with `meta charset` to prevent rendering errors. To validate and preserve compatibility with legacy browsers, this element must fit within the first 1024 bytes of the page.


### 2.4 \<body> {: .hN .gamma #body-element}

The `body` element represents the main content of the document, everything that is visible on the page. There can only be one `body` element, and it must be inside the `html` element below the `head`.

		<body>
			<!-- content goes here -->
		</body>
{: .prettyprint}

The `body` element accepts `class` and `id` attributes (along with [others](http://developers.whatwg.org/elements.html#global-attributes)) and can be styled with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>.


### 2.5 Putting it all together {: .hN .gamma #putting-it-all-together}

	<!doctype html>
	<html lang="en">
		<head>
			<meta charset="utf-8">
			<title>Document Title</title>
		</head>
		<body>
			<!-- content goes here -->
		</body>
	</html>
{: .prettyprint}

Congratulations, you've written a valid HTML5 document&mdash;too bad it's empty! Why not hone your skills [marking up a simple blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}/patterns/blog-entry), or brush up on your [HTML Etiquette]({{ site.baseurl }}/fundamentals/coding-conventions#html-etiquette).

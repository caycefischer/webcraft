Web-Craft is an online curriculum written to help design students master the web.



Web Design is complicated. The learning curve is steep, and often times concepts can be left behind as your technical skills spiral ever-higher. Without solid concepts to ground you, you could easily end up designing on autopilot: knowing all the tricks of the trade, but being utterly able to figure out how they work or why they’re used. Dive into The Web Professional’s Primer to brush up on the basics, improve your technique and master the fundamentals of good web design.



Web-Craft is a free online curriculum written to help design students become fluent with the web. Through articles and lessons that explore the fundamentals, tools and techniques of modern web design, Web-Craft draws from the collective knowledge of the web community to curate a thorough reference manual, educational resource and invaluable resource library.

Design on the web is young: unlike print, the established canon is vast and contradictory; theory often emerges from technical experimentation and the masters of web design work every day shaping and re-shaping the discipline. This presents many novices with a quandary: learning the basics can be tough when every day more material in that canonbecomes obsolete. Browser support changes, specs are rewritten, best-practices fall out of favor for better practices and across the web people write new tricks, hacks, experiments, boilerplates, frameworks, templates, etcetera.



Web-Craft is an educational programme dedicated to helping design students master the web. The meticulously researched curriculum is sourced from the work of the web's best and brightest, drawing upon an established canon of design practice and theory, 

Geared towards design students or others new to the field, Web-Craft establishes a strong base in the fundamentals of front-end web development, and explores the tools and techniques of modern web design through guided lessons and tutorials. In the future, long-form article/essays will be published in the Journal, with a view to gain insight into more advanced or theoretical aspects of web-craft.

Web-Craft can also be an invaluable reference for professionals, as a knowledge base with a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio. The research that informs each lesson is applied to a growing pattern & snippet library, well-documented with sample usage. Fitting hand-in-glove with these libraries is the Web-Craft Primer: a downloadable template (built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)) that establishes sensible defaults and mixes just the right components together into a well-balanced blank slate.

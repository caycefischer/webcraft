Web-Craft is an educational programme dedicated to helping design students become fluent with the web.  The meticulously researched curriculum is sourced from the work of the web's best and brightest, drawing upon an established canon of design practice and theory.

Geared towards design students or others new to the field, Web-Craft establishes a strong base in the fundamentals of front-end web development, and explores the tools and techniques of modern web design through guided lessons and tutorials. In the future, long-form article/essays will be published in the Journal, with a view to gain insight into more advanced or theoretical aspects of web-craft.

Web-Craft can also be an invaluable reference for professionals, as a knowledge base with a remarkable signal-to-noise ratio. The research that informs each lesson is applied to a growing pattern & snippet library, well-documented with sample usage. Fitting hand-in-glove with these libraries is the Web-Craft Primer: a downloadable template (built on the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com)) that establishes sensible defaults and mixes just the right components together into a well-balanced blank slate.

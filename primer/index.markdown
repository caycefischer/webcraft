title: "Primer Template"
description: "The Web-Craft Primer is a downloadable template (built on the HTML5 Boilerplate) that establishes sensible defaults and mixes just the right components together into a well-balanced blank slate to start your web projects."

The Web-Craft Primer is the product of a meticulous process of research and curation. It falls into the middle ground between a pure "blank-slate" HTML & CSS template, and a fully-featured, robust framework. It is _not_ meant to be treated as a 'black box' of code to be built upon&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the power of these files lies in customizing them to your needs for a specific project.

Built upon the shoulders of giants, the Primer incorporates code from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com), [Normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) and the work of many illustrious members of the web community. But far from being a hodgepodge of scrambled code from across the internet, the template is a robust, sensible and professional tool to put a coat of Primer on a new web project.

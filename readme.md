## About

This collection of files is the product of meticulous research and curation. It falls into the middle ground between a pure "blank-slate" HTML & CSS template, and a fully-featured framework. It is _not_ meant to be treated as a 'black box' of code to be built upon&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;the power of these files lies in customizing them to your needs for a specific project.
